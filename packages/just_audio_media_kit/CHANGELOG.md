## 2.1.0+jellybox.2 (LOCAL FORK)

- mpv log messages go through `debugPrint` instead of `print`, so they
  land in the in-app device log, and the default level is `warn` so
  audio output warnings ("Audio device underrun detected", ao/wasapi
  errors) are captured. Tracks issue #476 (Windows FLAC stutter).

## 2.1.0+jellybox.1 (LOCAL FORK)

- PATCH: `concatenatingInsertAll` moved the appended entry from index
  `length` instead of `length - 1`. mpv rejected the out-of-range
  `playlist-move` and media_kit's own list ignored it, so every insert
  silently became an append: "Play next" played the wrong song at the
  slot the app showed and surfaced the inserted song at the end of the
  queue, and remove-then-insert replacements (forward cache, requalify)
  scrambled the order the same way. Multi-child inserts now keep their
  relative order too (upstream moved each child to the same index,
  reversing them).

- Fix InvalidRangeError when there's no `Media` in `Playlist` ([#17](https://github.com/Pato05/just_audio_media_kit/pull/17), thanks [@lvyueyang](https://github.com/lvyueyang) and [@2shrestha22](https://github.com/2shrestha22))

## 2.0.5

- Override duration for [SilenceAudioSource]
- Fix desync issue when entry is removed from [ConcatenatingAudioSource] (Fixes [#12](https://github.com/Pato05/just_audio_media_kit/issues/12))

## 2.0.4

- Support `--prefetch-playlist` for gapless playback (fixes [#11](https://github.com/Pato05/just_audio_media_kit/issues/11))
- Reset `Duration` on track change (fixes [#10](https://github.com/Pato05/just_audio_media_kit/issues/10))

## 2.0.3

- Add `libmpv` parameter to `ensureInitialized` ([#9](https://github.com/Pato05/just_audio_media_kit/issues/9))

## 2.0.2

- Fix: defer setting initial position to when the track starts loading (fixes seeking before loading the track, which seems not to be currently supported by `media_kit`): see [related issue](https://github.com/Pato05/just_audio_media_kit/issues/6) and [`media_kit` related issue](https://github.com/media-kit/media-kit/issues/228)
- Add `SilenceAudioSource` support via anullsrc ([taken from just_audio_mpv](https://github.com/bleonard252/just_audio_mpv/blob/main/lib/src/mpv_player.dart#L137))

## 1.0.0

- Make private methods private, as they should've been
