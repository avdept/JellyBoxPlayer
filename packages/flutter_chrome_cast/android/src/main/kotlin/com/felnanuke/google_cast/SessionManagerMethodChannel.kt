/**
 * Flutter method channel for Google Cast session management
 * 
 * This class manages the complete lifecycle of Google Cast sessions, including session
 * creation, connection, monitoring, and termination. It implements the Google Cast
 * SessionManagerListener to receive session events and communicates session state
 * changes to Flutter in real-time.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Cast session lifecycle management (creation, connection, termination)
 * - Session state monitoring and event handling
 * - Device volume control during active sessions
 * - Integration with discovery manager for device selection
 * - Coordination with remote media client for media operations
 * - Real-time session updates to Flutter
 *
 * Architecture:
 * The class integrates with multiple Cast SDK components:
 * - SessionManager: Core Google Cast SDK session management
 * - DiscoveryManagerMethodChannel: For device selection during session creation
 * - RemoteMediaClientMethodChannel: For media operations during active sessions
 * - Session events are propagated to Flutter for UI updates
 *
 * Session Lifecycle:
 * 1. Session creation request from Flutter with device ID
 * 2. Device selection via discovery manager
 * 3. Session connection and status monitoring
 * 4. Session state synchronization with Flutter
 * 5. Session termination and cleanup
 *
 * @param discoveryManager Reference to discovery manager for device operations
